The focus knob seems like a tone knob, maybe more in the upper mids than the treble, but it does the job well.I wish it had a bit more gain.  Surprisingly, this pedal with the gain on 10 and the tone on 10, gives me a great metal tone all by itself!  If i boost the pedal with say a few db of clean boost, it gets me exactly where I'd want to be (a dry, tight metal tone, kinda 5150ish.  And while this isn't the purpose of the pedal, it is how I've ended up using it just because it sounds better than any amp sim and produces less heat than my tube amps.  It's tight, its raw, there is no fizz and no boomyness, just a healthy low end.  Crank the knobs on this thing to 10 and you have a very aggressive, tight tone that ma...</td>\n",

I think people get a confused because there are a few different installation set ups, but you just have to follow the instructions for the one you are doing and ignore the rest.I primarily bought this seat in this color because they do not use flame retardants on the cover. It does have that typical &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; smell to it from the packaging and foam inside, but I feel like a lot of that will come off when I wash it. The material is soft and cozy and,  yes, the seat is huge, but that's to be expected for a car seat that can turn into a booster and hold 100lbs. We can not fit it rear-facing behind the driver's seat of our mid-sized SUV, and I am only about 5'8.

While I love those, although they could cover a little better, Im not a big fan of this one. It goes on more difficulty than the BB cream, and I have to use more product too. This foundation also clings to any dry skin illuminating it.\\n\\nI kept the foundation on for an hour or so and looked at my face. Surprisingly, it seemed to have settled nicely.

We liked the idea of it being a front or back carrier, however it just doesn't seem to work with our bodies.  Our daughter seemed to be carried with her head by my ear when I tried it as a front pack.  The plastic side buckles to hold the child in place were not that secure, so when we used it we still held her for fear of them opening up - defeats the purpose of having your hands free!  We much rather use our FABULOUS Quattro tour system than this!!!   \n",

I chose Essie because of the colors that so many of the other reviews where raving about. However, I liked the color of this nail polish better on the screen than on my nails. But the color is objective, it probably just doesn't go with my skin tone. The quality seems good - I had to put on about 3 thin coats to get a solid color, and if you dry them well in between, it will stay on for at least 5 or 6 days.   \n",
       "204694  I bought this based on video reviews on the net.  My first impressions:To my ears, if the OCD / Ultimate OD simulates \"fat\" power tube distortion, this pedal simulates a lightly distorted tube pre-amp, with a bit of edge, sharpness, the kind of edge the tube amps have.  The focus knob seems like a tone knob, maybe more in the upper mids than the treble, but it does the job well.I wish it had a bit more gain.  Surprisingly, this pedal with the gain on 10 and the tone on 10, gives me a great metal tone all by itself!  If i boost the pedal with say a few db of clean boost, it gets me exactly where I'd want to be (a dry, tight metal tone, kinda 5150ish.  And while this isn't the purpose of the pedal, it is how I've ended up using it just because it sounds better than any amp sim and produces less heat than my tube amps.  It's tight, its raw, there is no fizz and no boomyness, just a healthy low end.  Crank the knobs on this thing to 10 and you have a very aggressive, tight tone that ma...   \n",
       "127503  We just got this seat yesterday and judging by the few low-star comments I was expecting a nightmare of an installation. It was actually really easy for me and took about 5 minutes. I think people get a confused because there are a few different installation set ups, but you just have to follow the instructions for the one you are doing and ignore the rest.I primarily bought this seat in this color because they do not use flame retardants on the cover. It does have that typical &#34;chemical&#34; smell to it from the packaging and foam inside, but I feel like a lot of that will come off when I wash it. The material is soft and cozy and,  yes, the seat is huge, but that's to be expected for a car seat that can turn into a booster and hold 100lbs. We can not fit it rear-facing behind the driver's seat of our mid-sized SUV, and I am only about 5'8. The passenger seat does have to be moved up quite a bit to fit it in, but my wife is small so it's not a big deal. I can see that it would...   \n",

It is pretty full coverage, and it sits well and doesnt seem to oxidize. It does come off easily to the touch, but overall, I like this for a more full coverage look than their B.B. cream.\\n\\nOriginal review:\\n\\nI have been using this brands BB creams for years. While I love those, although they could cover a little better, Im not a big fan of this one. It goes on more difficulty than the BB cream, and I have to use more product too. This foundation also clings to any dry skin illuminating it.\\n\\nI kept the foundation on for an hour or so and looked at my face. Surprisingly, it seemed to have settled nicely. My dry skin was no longer obvious, and it left me with a nice smooth finish. Overall, this is just okay. It may just be my skin, but I prefer the B.B. cream.   \n",

We've now removed the toy from the jumper &amp; it's one of his favorite toys (he could care less when he's jumping).  But now that he's bigger - 10mths &amp; 22lbs - this one really is not suitable for him.  The weight limit I believe is 25lbs, whereas the Graco Jumper Bumper weight limit is supposedly 90 something (which is absurd - no one at 90lbs could fit in that thing, let alone jump) - but still - it means that it comfortably fits him - without me sitting there watching tensely to make sure the spring doesn't fail or the rope doesn't give way.  Additionally - the graco jumper bumper has - as the name implies - a bumper - a rubber edge.  Not too big of a thing when they're 4-5mths old - but at 10mths my boy can...</td>\n",

They're cheap Chinese PsOS, and can be replaced with something a lot better.  Just unscrew the cover and swap them out!

       "57697   Our son is a jumper...he's loved it since he was 4-5 mths old & still loves it at 10mths.  We own two of these - this one for home & the Graco Jumper Bumper for the office.  Originally - I preferred this one - mainly because of the toy.  It spins - my son loves spinny things.  We've now removed the toy from the jumper & it's one of his favorite toys (he could care less when he's jumping).  But now that he's bigger - 10mths & 22lbs - this one really is not suitable for him.  The weight limit I believe is 25lbs, whereas the Graco Jumper Bumper weight limit is supposedly 90 something (which is absurd - no one at 90lbs could fit in that thing, let alone jump) - but still - it means that it comfortably fits him - without me sitting there watching tensely to make sure the spring doesn't fail or the rope doesn't give way.  Additionally - the graco jumper bumper has - as the name implies - a bumper - a rubber edge.  Not too big of a thing when they're 4-5mths old - but at 10mths my boy can...   \n",

I would recommend this britax to a friend.   \n",

They are the best bibs ever. The large size and over-the-shoulder design keep messy little eaters relatively clean. They also wash well and true to the manufacturer's claims, get softer with repeated washings. They also stay cute even as they fade. I have never used them as burp cloths but as bibs they more than suffice.   \n",

We have liked it for the most part.  The biggest problem is with the battery life.After about 9 or 10 months, it simply wouldn't take or hold a charge.  Very frustrating!  I was about to trash it and buy another, until I discovered that there is an easy solution.  Inside the parent unit are 3 low-performing rechargeable AA batteries.  They're cheap Chinese PsOS, and can be replaced with something a lot better.  Just unscrew the cover and swap them out! I like the Sanyo Eneloop brand personally, but any higher end Ni-MH rechargeable battery will work. Those will charge right in the unit and should do a much better job keeping a charge for you.  Good luck!   \n",

       "132681  This is a very good gate, and we'd definitely buy it again.  I'll go through all of the positive and negative points that we have found after buying it and using it for a few weeks.First, let's talk about installation.  This was generally quite easy to accomplish with minimal fuss and time required.  I installed the whole gate in about an hour from opening the box through completed installation.  Considering that this was combined with keeping my twin 1-year-olds safe, happy, and occupied, it should take less than half an hour for most people.  Installation consisted of:* Selecting the installation location* Tracing the screw locations on the wall* Drilling holes in the wall* Installing anchors in the holes (I had a plentiful supply of appropriate anchors to use, but you might need some from your local hardware store)* Screwing the anchor plates to the prepared locations using the included screws* Extending the gate* Attaching the gate to the anchors (it's a simple matter of droppi...   \n",
